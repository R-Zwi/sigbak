.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sigbak
.Ar command
.Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility to read the backups created by the Signal Android app.
It can be used to export messages, attachments and other data.
.Pp
A Signal backup consists primarily of an SQLite database.
This database contains the messages, amongst other things.
Attachments, avatars and stickers, however, are stored as separate files in the
backup.
.Pp
Every Signal backup is encrypted with a 30-digit passphrase.
By default,
.Nm
prompts for the passphrase.
Alternatively, the
.Fl p
option (see below) may be used to specify a file that contains the passphrase.
Whitespace in the passphrase is ignored.
.Pp
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.Tg check
.It Ic check-backup Oo Fl p Ar passfile Oc Ar backup
.D1 Pq Alias: Ic check

.Sh CSV FORMAT
The
.Ic export-messages
command can export messages in CSV format.
In this format, each record describes either a message or a message reaction,
and consists of the following eight fields.
.Pp
The
.Em first
field is an integer specifying the time a message or reaction was sent.
For incoming messages, the
.Em second
field is an integer specifying the time a message or reaction was received.
The times in these two fields are specified in Unix time, with millisecond
precision.
.Pp
The
.Em third
field is an integer specifying the thread id.
.Pp
The
.Em fourth
field is an integer specifying the message type.
A value of 0 indicates an incoming message, 1 indicates an outgoing message,
and 2 indicates a reaction.
Reaction records always immediately follow after the record of the message they
are reactions to.
.Pp
The
.Em fifth
field is an integer specifying the number of attachments a message has.
For reactions, this field is 0.
.Pp
The
.Em sixth
field is a string containing the phone number of the sender or recipient.
For outgoing messages sent to a group, this field is the string
.Sq group .
.Pp
The
.Em seventh
field is a string containing the name of the sender, recipient or group.
.Pp
The
.Em eighth
field is a string containing the message text or reaction emoji.
